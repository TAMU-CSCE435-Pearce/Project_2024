### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort (Bonnie): 
- Sample Sort (Arielle)s:
- Merge Sort (Victoria):
- Radix Sort (Vic):
```
// Initialize MPI
MPI_Init()
Get the number of processes (n_procs)
Get the rank of each process (rank)

// Main process (rank 0), read and distribute the data
if rank == 0 then
    Read the input array
    Split the input data into n_procs parts
end if

// Scatter the data to all processes given the main process of 0
MPI_Scatter(data, local_data, root=0)

// For each digit LSD to MSD:
for each digit in LSD to MSD do
    // Count the frequency of each digit in the local data
    local_histogram = calculate_histogram(local_data, digit)
    
    // Share and combine all local histograms to create a global histogram
    global_histogram = MPI_Allreduce(local_histogram, MPI_SUM)

    // Use the global histogram to figure out where data needs to go
    prefix_sum = calculate_prefix_sum(global_histogram)
    
    // Exchange data between processes based on prefix_sum
    MPI_Alltoallv(local_data, send_counts, recv_counts, sorted_data)

    // Update local data with the received sorted data
    local_data = sorted_data
end for

// Gather all the sorted data back to process 0
MPI_Gather(local_data, sorted_array, root=0)

// Finalize MPI (clean up and end the program)
MPI_Finalize()

```

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

- Merge Sort:
```
    Main:  
        1. Initialize MPI - MPI_Init()
            a. MPI_INIT(&argc, &argv)
        2. Rank and size of MPI COMM_WORLD
            a. MPI_Comm_rank, MPI_Comm_size
        3. If rank == 0 then: read in the input array, split the input array into the number of processes part
            a. Use a fixed array for sorting so it is the same across all different types of sorting 
            b. no variable is our size of array 
        4. Broadcast that size of array to all the processes using MPI_Bcast
            a. MPI_Bcast(no, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD)
        5. Find the size of each subarray for each of the process: subSize = no  / world size (from mpi_comm_size)
        6. Allocate a memory for each processâ€™s subarray with subSize
        7. Scatter the original array into all the subarrays
            a. MPI_Scatter()
        8. Allocate temp array for merging with subSize
        9. Every process will perform merge sort on its own subarray 
            a. mergeSort(subarray, temparray, 0, subSize-1)
        10. Root process - gathers all the sorted subarrays 
            a. World rank is 0, we want to make a sorted array with the size of the array (no)
        11. Perform MPI_Gather to grab all the sorted subarrays from all the processes 
        12. Final merge with the root process so world rank is 0, create another array with the no variable size and use mergeSort function
        13. Add a print statement that prints out the sorted array to check 
        14. Free any memory and finalize the MPI environment: MPI_Finalize()


    Merge Function: * merge two sorted halves of one array into a complete sorted single array*
        1. Set lh= to the start index to the left half, set i= to the start index for the temporary array (temp array), 
            set rh= to the starting index of the right half (ending index of the first half + 1)
        2. While loop to start merging and compare the elements in both halves: * loop will finish after one half is processed* -> 
            While (lh <= ending index of first half && rh <= ending index of that array portion needed to sort)
                a. If current element array[lh] is <= to the current element in the right half so array[rh] we want to copy the array[lh] into the temp array at i and then increment the lh and the i
                b. Else we want to do the opposite so array[rh] to temp array at i and increment the rh and the i
        3. Remaining elements will be copied:
            a. If there are elements in the right half leftover or the left it will be copied into the temp array 
            b. Check the index and the end of side index to see if one side has been fully processed or not 
        4. Copy the sorted elements from the temp array all back to the original array
            a. using a for loop and the indexes 

    MergeSort Function: *recursive merge sort algorithm without impacting any MPI*
        1. Check if the starting index is less than the ending index of the array -> if LI < RI -> want to make sure the array 
            has more than one element
                a. Find the middle index: mid = (LI + RI) / 2, average of left and right index divided by 2
                b. Recursively call mergeSort so it can sort the left half -> LI to mid, left index to mid index 
                c. Recursively call mergeSort so it can sort the right half -> mid+1, RI, mid+1 index to right index
                d. Merge Function called so we can combine it into a single sorted array 
	
```


### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes: 2^16, 2^18, 2^20, 2^22, 2^24, 2^26, 2^28
- Input types: Sorted, Random, Reverse sorted, 1% perturbed
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
- For number of processors: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024
