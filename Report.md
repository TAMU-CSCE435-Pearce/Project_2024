## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort: 
- Sample Sort: 
- Merge Sort: 
- Radix Sort: Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that orders elements by processing them digit by digit. Radix sort operates by sorting numbers based on individual digits, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) and moving towards the most significant digit (MSD). It is a non comparative sorting algorithm that ends up being slower than comparison algorithmns in most situations.

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes
1. Initialize MPI environment.
2. Divide the array of numbers among available processes.
3. Local Sorting (using Counting Sort by each process):
4. Each process sorts its local portion of the array based on the current digit (using a stable sort like counting sort).
5. After each process sorts its part, the results need to be gathered and redistributed across processes for the next digit sort.
6. Repeat for Each Digit

```cpp
//Initialize MPI
//Initialize rank
//Initialize numprocesses
//totalSize is length of vector

 if (rank == 0) {
    // Generate or input the array on the root process
    for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; i++) {
        arr[i] = rand() % 1000;  // Example random values
    }
}

//Split the array based on the processes
int localSize = totalSize / numProcesses;
vector<int> localArr(localSize);
//Use MPI Scatter here to distribute the array to the different processes

//Perform Radix Sort
// Broadcast the maximum number in each Radix sort
// Sort each digit starting from the LSD
    // If rank == 0
        //MPI Gather all sub sorted arrays into one global array
    // Else
        //MPI Gather the individual process sorted array
    //MPI Scatter the sorted array to all processes for next iteration

//MPI Gather sorted arrays on the root process

if (rank == 0) {
    // Output the sorted array (on root process)
    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

Repeat the local sort and gather steps for each digit, starting from the least significant to the most significant digit.
### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
