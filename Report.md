# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 

## 1. Group members:
1. Amine Sakrout
2. Amol Gupta
3. Quenton Hua
4. Mohsin Khan
5. Oreoluwa Ogunleye-Olawuyi

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort:
- Sample Sort: This algorithm splits up the dataset into smaller sample sizes and sorts these smaller groups using something like merge or quick sort. This sorting can be parallelized using OpenMPI to speed up this process. Once these groups are sorted they are merged together to yeild a fully sorted list.
- Merge Sort:
- Radix Sort:
- Column Sort:

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
