### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort: 
- Sample Sort: Sample sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that provides a more statistical approach to bucket sort. The efficiency of bucket sort is heavily dependent on the distribution of elements amongst the selected buckets; however, evenly distributing the buckets if you preselect bucket ranges would require domain knowledge on what elements the input arrays will contain. Instead, sample sort leverages sample collection in an attempt to estimate bucket ranges that will provide an even distribution of elements amongst buckets. Essentialy, we draw a sample of elements (with a certain number of elements being selected from each segment of the input array), sort this sample, select pivots from the sorted sample, distribute the elements amongst buckets delineated by these pivots, perform a comparitive sorting algorithm on each bucket, then merge the sorted buckets back together.
- Merge Sort: 
- Radix Sort: Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that orders elements by processing them digit by digit. Radix sort operates by sorting numbers based on individual digits, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) and moving towards the most significant digit (MSD). It is a non comparative sorting algorithm that ends up being slower than comparison algorithmns in most situations.

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- [DELETE BEFORE SUBMISSION] For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
