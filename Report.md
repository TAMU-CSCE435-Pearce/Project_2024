# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 20

## 1. Group members:
1. Victoria Chen
2. Arielle Shaver
3. Victoria Chiang
4. Bonnie Wu

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)
Parallel Sorting Algorithms

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort (Bonnie): 
- Sample Sort (Arielle)s:
- Merge Sort (Victoria):
- Radix Sort (Vic):

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
