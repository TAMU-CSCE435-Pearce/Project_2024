## 2. Project topic 

## _Parallel Sorts_

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort:
- Sample Sort:
- Merge Sort:
- Radix Sort: This is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts integers/strings by processing individual digits/characters. It will be implemented in a parallel manner and will be tested on multi-core processors. Grace is what we are going to use which allows us to measure performance metric such as execution time and resrouce utilization across different configurations

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes
- Bitonic Sort:

- Sample Sort:

- Merge Sort:

- Radix Sort:


### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
